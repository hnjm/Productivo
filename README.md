Productivo is a productivity app which combines budget management feature, note-taking, and an alarm clock all at once.

# Creators
We are a team of second year computer science students. This is in partial fulfillment of our CMSC 127 class, File Processing and Database Systems. Completed on AY 2016-2017, second semester.

We are Jose Arniel Pama (implemented the budget planner), Icel Ann Rodriguez (implemented note-taking), and Lovely Grace Arsolon (implemented the alarm clock).
